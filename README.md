# poolGateTestRun

This project is a test run to evaluate the viability of using YOLOv8 and an existing security camera to determine if a pool gate is in the open or closed position.

This test will use a very small dataset of images (20 open and 20 closed) and will be run for a few epochs as possible to gauge the potential of a larger dataset with many more epochs.
